I put these in ~/.local/bin, but to use this directory (you may need to make it)

- `battery-notify.py` and `media-notify.py` are both OSDs written in python and use mako.
- `pokemon-encounter.py` is used by zshrc - random chance of getting a shiny chickorita
- `dark-mode.py` and `light-mode.py` are both yin-yang scripts
- `hyprpicker-extended.sh` is a wrapper for hyprpicker that produces a notification and copies the hex code to clipboard
